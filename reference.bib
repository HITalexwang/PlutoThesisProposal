	can efficiently model the long-range dependencies between words and make the
	resulting sentence more likely to be grammatically correct. Our model firstly
	encode the source sentence with a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
	(BI-LSTM) and then use the neural attention as a pointer to select an ordered
	sub sequence of the input as the output. Experiments show that our model
	achieves the state-of-the-art f-score of  86.7\% on the commonly used English
	Switchboard test set. We also evaluate the performance of our model on the
	in-house annotated Chinese data and achieve a significantly higher f-score
	compared to the baseline of CRF-based approach.},

	abstract = {In this paper we focus on the effect of on-line speech segmentation and disfluency removal methods on conversational speech translation. In a real-time conversational speech to speech translation system, on-line segmentation of speech is required to avoid latency beyond few seconds. While sentential unit segmentation and disfluency removal have been heavily studied mainly for off-line speech processing, to the best of our knowledge, the combined effect of these tasks on conversational speech translation has not been investigated. Furthermore, optimization of performance given maximum allowable system latency to enable a conversation is a newer problem for these tasks. We show that the conventional assumption of doing segmentation followed by disfluency removal is not the best practice. We propose a new approach to do simple-disfluency removal followed by segmentation and then by complex-disfluency removal. The proposed approach shows a significant gain on translation performance of up to 3 Bleu points with only 6 second latency to look ahead, using state-of-the-art machine translation and speech recognition systems.},
